# Experience Modules

## Within Myriad, your newsfeed algorithms -- the computer code that controls what posts appear to you -- are transparently shown and can be chosen, remixed, or removed.

## *Why*

### Mainstream Social Media have designed their newsfeed algorithms for maximum interaction and minimum social value, preferring to lock people within their own mediation bubbles and divide the world based on differing opinions. 

### Dissenting voices can be shadow-banned and deranked in your feed, and you wouldn't even know. 

## *How*

### Experience Modules (packages of newsfeed algorithms) that determines your user experiences on Myriad, based on low-code tools, are provided like apps in an app store. 

### Users may select from the provided algorithms, create their own, or customize an existing algorithm.

### Besides determining the posts you see on your feed, experience modules on Myriad determine how you can interact with the post or with other users. You may want to experience a certain topic (e.g. #news) with a "LinkedIn-Like" experience module, and other topics (e.g #photos) with an "Instagram-like" module.
