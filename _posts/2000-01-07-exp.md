# Experience Modules

## Within Myriad, your newsfeed algorithms -- the computer code that controls what posts appear to you -- are transparently shown and can be chosen, remixed, or removed.

## *Why*

### Mainstream Social Media have designed their newsfeed algorithms for maximum interaction and minimum social value, preferring to lock people within their own mediation bubbles and divide the world based on differing opinions. 

### Dissenting voices can be shadow-banned and deranked in your feed, and you wouldn't even know. 

## *How*

### Experience Modules (packages of newsfeed algorithms) that determines your user experiences on Myriad, based on low-code tools, are provided like apps in an app store. 

### Users may select from the provided algorithms, create their own, or customize an existing algorithm. These algorithms are not just simple searches -- cognitive computing tools are used to detect post topics, check the sentiment of the post, and identify objects within a photo.

### Besides determining the posts you see on your feed, experience modules on Myriad determine how you can interact with the post or with other users. You may want to experience a certain topic (e.g. #news) with a "LinkedIn-Like" experience module, and other topics (e.g #photos) with an "Instagram-like" module.

## Example Algorithms (Pseudocode)

**User only wants to follow blockchain technology posts that are not crypto related.**
{% highlight text linenos=table %}
if Post.contains("#blockchain") and 
(Post.contains("#technology") or Post.contains("#tech"))
and not Post.contains("#crypto*") then
show Post as news 100% of the time
{% endhighlight %}


**User wants to create an Instagram-like feed of cat photos**
{% highlight text linenos=table %}
if Post.type=photo 
and visualrecognition(Post.photo).contains("animal:cat") then
show Post.photo as insta 100% of the time
{% endhighlight %}


**User wants to create feed that combines people who agree with her most of the time and disagree with her politically some of the time**
{% highlight text linenos=table %}
if (User.politics<>My.politics) show User.Post 70% of the time
if (User.politics==My.politics) show User.Post 30% of the time
{% endhighlight %}


**User wants to create feed that only has positive news items**
{% highlight text linenos=table %}
if sentimentscore(Post.linkedarticle)>70 then show Post as newsreader 100% of the time.
{% endhighlight %}
