## Myriad.Social combines three main concepts:
|  | Choose-Your-Own-Algorithms | Anti-Social Media | Kudos |
| -------------- | :--------- | ----------: | :----------: |
| What: | Newsfeed algorithms -- the computer code that controls what posts appear to you -- are transparently shown and can be chosen, remixed, or removed. | The ability to follow topics from all public posts on every social network, without signing up to *any* social network. |  An interaction layer over the current social internet, allowing you to send monetizable "kudos" to any social media post. |
| Why: | Mainstream Social Media have designed their newsfeed algorithms for maximum interaction and minimum social value, preferring to lock people within their own mediation bubbles and divide the world based on differing opinions. Dissenting voices can be shadow-banned and deranked in your feed, and you wouldn't even know. | Mainstream Social Media mediate your experiences within their platform and can instantly deplatform anyone. | Mainstream Social Media force you to log on to their platforms to interact and pay with creators, and may prevent certain creators from monetizing their content. |
| How: | A News Feed Algorithm platform that determines your user experiences on Myriad, based on low-code tools, provided like apps in an app store. Users may select from the provided algorithms, create their own, or customize an existing algorithm. Multiple algorithms can be combined into packs. |  Using largely open-source APIs, Myriad grabs current public posts from Mainstream Social Media and puts them in your feed based on the algorithm packs you select. | A blockchain provides the ability for users to send "kudos tokens" to certain posts, even if the post creator is not yet on Myriad.Social. The kudos tokens would be locked by a smart contract until the post creator creates an account and proves her ownership of the post. Proof is *not* done via SSO (Single-Sign-On). Instead, the platform provides a passphrase that needs to be posted by the claimant within 24 hours on the related platform. The kudos would only be unlocked once the passphrase is posted. |
