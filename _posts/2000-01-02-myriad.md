# Myriad at a Glance

Myriad aims at creating an online social environment where users can interact freely, without being influenced by profit-driven algorithms, fake accounts, and reputation manipulation.

Because freedom of speech, information and user generated content should not be at the mercy of a single centralized entity, we have chosen to develop Myriad as a modular, decentralized platform which rests on 3 tenets.

**Users should be sovereign**, free to chose where they source their information and how they want it displayed, informed about the bubbles they build, or strive to escape.

**As long as it is legal, information should be free and uncensored** , so all opinions should be heard and debated without fear of retribution. 

**Accountability and incentive should be driving forces throughout the network.** Content creators should strive when they deliver quality, while poor content should be discouraged. 

**Myriad will be built on the [Parity Substrate](https://www.parity.io/substrate/) and will be a complete blockchain to build social media *experiences* on.**
