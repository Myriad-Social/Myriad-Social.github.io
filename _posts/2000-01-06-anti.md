# Anti-Social Media

## The ability to follow topics from all public posts on every social network, without signing up to *any* social network.

### Why: Mainstream Social Media mediate your experiences within their platform and can instantly deplatform anyone, up to and including the US President.

### How: Using largely open-source APIs, Myriad grabs current public posts from Mainstream Social Media and puts them in your feed based on the algorithm packs you select.
