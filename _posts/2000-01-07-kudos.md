# Kudos

## An interaction layer over the current social internet, allowing you to send monetizable "kudos" to any social media post. 

## *Why* 

### Mainstream Social Media force you to log on to their platforms to interact and pay with creators, and may prevent certain creators from monetizing their content. 

## *How*

### A blockchain provides the ability for users to send "kudos tokens" to certain posts, even if the post creator is not yet on Myriad.Social. The kudos tokens would be locked by a smart contract until the post creator creates an account and proves her ownership of the post. 

### Proof-of-Ownership is *not* provided via SSO (Single-Sign-On). Instead, the platform provides a passphrase that needs to be posted by the claimant within 24 hours on the related platform. Kudos would only be unlocked once the passphrase is posted.
