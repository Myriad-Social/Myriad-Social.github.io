# Kudos

## A monetization layer over the current social internet, allowing you to send "kudos" to any social media post. 

## *Why* 

### Mainstream Social Media force you to log on to their platforms to interact and pay with creators, and may prevent certain creators from monetizing their content. 

## *How*

### A blockchain provides the ability for users to send "kudos tokens" to certain posts, even if the post creator is not yet on Myriad.Social. The kudos tokens would be locked by a smart contract until the post creator creates an account and proves her ownership of the post. 

### Proof-of-Ownership does *not* have to be provided via SSO (Single-Sign-On). Instead, the platform provides a passphrase that needs to be inserted by the claimant within 24 hours into the related post. Kudos would only be unlocked once the passphrase is posted.
