# TOOLS FOR MAKING YOUR OWN DECENTRALIZED SOLUTIONS
## Personal Comments
I added this section since I realized that a lot of these decentralized tools aren't commonly known -- not even among blockchain developers. Sure, a lot of people have heard about Ethereum & Corda, but what about OpenWRT & GUN? 

Since I'm not much of a developer nowadays (these days I only use no-code or low-code tools and consume cool APIs), I'm just going to give a quick comment on each of these tools. I'm hoping this section could be used by people who are smarter than me to make even cooler decentralized solutions. Send me an Ethereum fraction if the page helped you make something, though!

## STUFF TO READ
### "CONFLICT RESOLUTION WITH GUNS"
What is it: A cool presentation that gives an overview of why #distributedsystemsmatter. Goes deep into the philosophies of internode conflict resolution and touches upon physics and graph math.

### "UNHOSTED"
What is it: A start-from-basics guide to creating serverless web applications with no back end. "Serverless" here does not mean "the backend is managed on the cloud, you don't need to deploy anything" like how it's defined by enterprise players like Amazon (Lambda & S3). Instead, "serverless" here means that the web app does not send any data to the server. A true serverless app does everything in your browser, and even when it needs to connect to another app, it does so using a p2p connection.
