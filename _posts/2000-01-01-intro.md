## HI THERE.

# My name is Pandu Sastrowardoyo and I do Blockchain stuff.

**Decentri.city is a *review and repository site for decentralized technology* -- Blockchain and non-Blockchain -- that anyone can run in a *self-hosted* way.** 

I've been a decentralized technology **fanatic** for about a decade. I do have a soft spot in my heart for Blockchain simply because it allows decentralized technologies to **incentivize node runners**. (Also, due to hype and the profit incentive, Blockchain has been the main focus of a lot of conversations about decentralization.)

However, that mechanism is **not the only game in town**. And thus, I'm planning to use this site to cover decentralization strategies that are a lot more general than Blockchain.

If you choose to follow me here (or on my Facebook or Linkedin), expect a lot more focus towards consumer-facing technology and enabling individuals and communities to thrive digitally without having to entrust their data, identity, and financials to **Faceless MegaCorps (FMCs)** or **Overly Big Government Entities (OBGEs).**

You may find ICO, IEO, STO, or DeFi reviews here but I don't think I have a lot to contribute to the topic. I might review technologies that are associated with certain cryptocurrency, but please do not consider these reviews investment advice. **Token value, in my experience, has rarely been a direct function of technology value.**

**I believe that the evolution of computing will lead humans (and posthumans) towards one of two alternate paths:**

- A world with the **illusion of freedom, packaged by FMCs and OBGEs working together**, feeding you platitudes while censoring and shadowbanning voices of dissent, ending with *a transhuman future when you don't own your own mind, let alone the servers running those minds*, or

- A world with **true freedom & liberty**, with individual data independence and systems working together, where *your identity, data, and (digital) minds are your own.*

## Let's take the 2nd choice.
